IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition x64 is reccomended for the execution of each program.
I have personally used IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition x64 for the completion of this assignment.
"part1.java" is the first question. Execution of the file can be done normally through IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition x64 .
"part2.java" is the second question. Execution of the file can be done noramlly through IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition x64. 
"part3.java" is the third question. Execution of the file can be done normally through IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition x64.
In the 4th part there are two files that are required to execute the program.
The program will excute while running "FileOpener.java" and having the "Histogram.java"
"test2.txt" & "blah.txt" are the test run files for "FileOpener.java" to produce a histogram.
Any text file can be used to produce an output of a Histogram.
The program will excute while running "FileOpener.java" and having the "Histogram.java" in IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition x64.
Clicking on view raw will allow you to view the files.
Download will allow you to download the Microsoft Word Document onto your personal device.
